# MQTT Mini-Explorer 🚀📡

## Client sender

This is a straightforward MQTT client that sends two key pieces of information: 💡 light levels and 🌡️ temperature readings.

I embarked on this project for a hands-on practice session with MQTT, aiming to get a good feel of how it operates in the real world. 🌎💼

This client was specifically set up to connect with a Mosquitto broker, ensuring a seamless flow of data. 📶🔌
