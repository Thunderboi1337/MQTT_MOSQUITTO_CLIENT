# MQTT Mini-Explorer 🚀📡

## Client sender

This is a straightforward MQTT client that sends two key pieces of information: 💡 light levels and 🌡️ temperature readings.

I did this project to get some hand on MQTT time, was try to get a good feel of how it works.

This client was used on a Eps32.

This client was specifically set up to connect with a Mosquitto broker, The broker was set up on my pc 📶🔌
